What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was not clear on the process of fetching and merging changes to the the remote repo after a pull request has been merged.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? 
-How to track, add, and commit changes in Git
-How to push changes to the remote repo
-Creating and merging pull requests

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? 
I asked questions on creating and merging pull requests, details on how to navigate the GitHub interface throughout the process, and workflow after the changes have been merged.

What still confuses you about git? I am curious to know how what it is like to work with Git and GitHub on an actual project.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 
I paired with a guide who was extermely knowledgeable and helpful. The guide answerd my questions clearly and concisely and I had a very positive and productive learning experience.
